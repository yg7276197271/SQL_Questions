--Notice, for the DateOfBirth column we have use DateTime data type.
--When a record is inserted, both the date and time parts are stored in the table.
--If you have used the Date data type instead, you would not have the time part stored and 
--as a result the queries would have been slightly easier. 

--However, in most cases it would be useful to capture the date and time when a transaction has occurred 
--as apposed to just the date part. Hence I have used DateTime data type.
