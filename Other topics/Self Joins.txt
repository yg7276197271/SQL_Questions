--Self Join Query:
--A MANAGER is also an EMPLOYEE. Both the, EMPLOYEE and MANAGER rows, are present in the same table.
-- Here we are joining tblEmployee with itself using different alias names, E for Employee and M for Manager. 
--We are using LEFT JOIN, to get the rows with ManagerId NULL.
-- You can see in the output TODD's record is also retrieved, but the MANAGER is NULL. 
--If you replace LEFT JOIN with INNER JOIN, you will not get TODD's record.

Create table tblEmployee
(
     EmployeeID int primary key,
     Name nvarchar(50),
     ManagerID int
)
Go


Insert into tblEmployee values (1, 'Mike',  3)
Insert into tblEmployee values (2, 'Rob',  1)
Insert into tblEmployee values (3, 'Todd',  null)
Insert into tblEmployee values (4, 'Ben',  1)
Insert into tblEmployee values (5, 'Sam',  1)



Select E.Name as Employee, M.Name as Manager
from tblEmployee E
Left Join tblEmployee M
On E.ManagerId = M.EmployeeId


--In short, joining a table with itself is called as SELF JOIN. SELF JOIN is not a different type of JOIN. 
--It can be classified under any type of JOIN - INNER, OUTER or CROSS Joins. The above query is, LEFT OUTER SELF Join.

Inner Self Join tblEmployee table:
Select E.Name as Employee, M.Name as Manager
from tblEmployee E
Inner Join tblEmployee M
On E.ManagerId = M.EmployeeId

Cross Self Join tblEmployee table:
Select E.Name as Employee, M.Name as Manager
from tblEmployee
Cross Join tblEmployee
